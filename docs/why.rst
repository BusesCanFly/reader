Why *reader*?
=============


Why make a feed reader library?
-------------------------------

I wanted a feed reader that is:

* accessible from multiple devices
* fast
* with a simple UI
* self-hosted (for privacy reasons)
* modular / easy to extend (so I can change stuff I don't like)
* written in Python (see above)

The fact that I couldn't find one extensible enough bugged me so much that I decided to make my own; a few years later, I ended up with what I would've liked to use when I first started.


Why make your own feed reader?
------------------------------

So you can:

* have full control over your data
* control what features it has or doesn't have
* decide how much you pay for it
* make sure it doesn't get closed while you still use it
* really, it's `easier than you think`_

Obviously, this may not be your cup of tea, but if it is, *reader* can help.
