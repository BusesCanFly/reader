    Only wraps exceptions that are unlikely to be programming errors (bugs),
    can only be fixed by the user (e.g. access permission denied), and aren't
    domain-related (those should have other custom exceptions).

    This is an imprecise science, since the DB-API exceptions are somewhat
    fuzzy in their meaning and we can't access the SQLite result code.
